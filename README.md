# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

This project aims to identify credit card customers who are most likely to churn using machine learning techniques. The completed project will include a Python package that follows coding best practices, such as adhering to PEP8 guidelines, implementing modular and documented code, and incorporating testing for robustness. The package will provide flexibility to be executed interactively or through a command-line interface (CLI).
